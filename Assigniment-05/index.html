    <h1>Roast Duck with Figs</h1>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <!--This is a comment-->
    <ul>
      <li>2 cups ruby port</li>
      <li>1 cup red wine</li>
      <li>3 Tbsp. whole black peppercorns</li>
      <li>2 shallots, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>1 bunch thyme</li>
      <li>8 duck breasts</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>2 Tbsp. unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 lb. purple figs</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>In a small saucepan, combine the port with the wine, peppercorns, and shallots and bring to a boil.
      Reduce the heat to maintain a simmer and cook until reduced to 3‚ÅÑ4 cup, about <b>25 minutes</b>.
      Remove the port reduction from the heat, pour through a fine sieve, and discard the solids.</li>
      <li>Season the flesh side of each duck breast with salt and pepper. Arrange 4 duck breasts, skin side-down,
      in a 12-inch skillet. Place the skillet over <i>medium-high</i> heat and cook the duck breasts,
      without flipping, until some of their fat renders and their skin is crisp,<b>5 to 6 minutes</b>.
      Flip the duck breasts, pour in half the port reduction and cook, basting with sauce,
      until the duck is browned and cooked to desired doneness, about <b>3 minutes</b> for medium rare or
      until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the duck reads <i>130</i>.
      Transfer the duck breasts to a cutting board and let stand <b>10 minutes</b>; reserve the reduction.
      Repeat cooking with the remaining 4 duck breasts and the port reduction.</li>
      <li>Wipe the skillet clean, add the butter, and melt over medium-high heat. Add the figs and cook,
      turning, until golden, about <b>3 minutes</b>. Remove from the figs from the heat and cut the duck breasts into thin slices.
      Transfer the figs and duck slices to a serving platter and drizzle with the reserved reduction before serving.</li>
    </ol>
