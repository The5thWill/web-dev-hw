How many main document <head> and <body> elements can a page have? How are these elements different, or what role do they play?

A page can have one of each and the head element gives you what is not on the page but what will be seen when looking for the page or what you can read before entering the page itself and the body is what will be on the page.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

For this assignment first I read through the Website about what we would be doing.  Then I went to Moodle for the specific instructions where I found out we would need a recipe.  So after discovering the need for a recipe and a corresponding image I looked for a duck recipe as I happened to hunt ducks this weekend and was looking for a good way to cook them anyway.  Once I found a recipe and an image I finished reading Moodle.  Finally I opened up the walkthrough and worked while it was playing and now I am finishing with the Read me.
