Briefly describe the difference between divs, classes, ids, and spans.

Span and Dives are used to group together chunks information in an html page and apply things to them to do this they most commonly use the hooks classes and ids.  While ids and classes are both hooks the difference between them is that classes are not unique while ids are.  This means that an element can only can only have 1 id but can have multiple classes and elements on a page can't share ids but they can share a class.  The difference between divs and spans is that spans are in-line and divs are block-line.

What is "alt text," and why do we use it?

Alt text is text you add as an attribute in an HTML document which is used describe to viewers the contents of an image. We use alt text as descriptors to help site visitors to understand an image or we can even use it as hyperlinks to expand the connectivity of our sites.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment.

In this assignment I did what I usually have been doing read the website first, Moodle second and then work alongside the walkthrough.  For this particular assignment an issue arose but I can't seem to fix it.  In my imbedded video from youtube (the official music video) every time I click on it, it says video unavailable but it plays fine in youtube and I even tried another video and it still won't work could you possible email me with what went wrong after you look at it that would be much appreciated.
