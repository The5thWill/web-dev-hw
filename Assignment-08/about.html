      <h1>About My Assignment 8</h1>
      <ul>
      <li>
        <h2>Why I choose this project</h2>
          <p>I choose this project because of my love for drawing and my exitement at the idea of getting others involved in
          something that I honestly enjoy to do.  On top of that my love for dogs made me choose to do this
          totorial on them and one of my favorite dog breeds are German Shepherds so I narrowed it down to them.</p>
      </li>

        <h2>What does it mean for me</h2>
          <p>For me it means a good deal being able to get more people into drawing, but more than that this class teaching me the
          skills needed to make websites is much apritated.  I feel like I am no loger quite so in the dark about what makes
          websites and I hop to use this new skill a great deal in the future possible even for my art which is great.</p>

        <h2>Where you can learn more</h2>
          <p>Honestly, If you want to learn more about drawing there are so many rescorces all over online and the number of classes
          you can find just about anywhere is substantial but more than that if you want to be better at drawing practice is most
          important so just go out and do it. </p>
