Describe any forms you've come across while browsing the web. What purposes do the serve?

I have certainly run into many forms while browsing the internet but there is one kind I seem to run into the majority of the time and that is forms used to sign you into an account on whatever page you are on.  Forms are made to allow you to enter information or leave feedback on someone else's sight or to allow you to navigate to your personal account while preventing others from going there.

List examples of a text, selection, and button input, and where they might be used.

Text Inputs are for short pices of information that you can type in and has may possibilities so things like usernames would fall into this category.  Selection Inputs are for questions with a select few possible answers so it would be good for something like which gender someone is. Button Inputs are to submit information to the owner of a site or for things like sending something out so it would be something like the Sign In button you hit after entering your username and Password

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment

For this assignment first I read through the Website about what we would be doing.  Then I went to Moodle for the specific instructions.  I liked learning about forms this week because it was something I knew little about but was also quite curious about when I saw them. After spending a while looking at stuff on forms I chose my shop and got to work using the walkthrough for any help I needed.
