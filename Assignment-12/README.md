Who was your imaginary client? How did they describe their site needs?

My imaginary client was a up and coming photographer who needed a site to display their work, give some info about themselves, and allow for others to contact them back with criticism, requests or offers.

What is the difference between display: block, display: inline, and display: inline-block?

The major difference is that display inline-block allows to set a width and height on the element as compared to display inline.
display block means that the element is displayed as paragraphs and headers in a block. A block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no HTML elements next to it usually.
