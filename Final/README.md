Did you learn anything new about web development (ie using GitHub, version control, repositories)?

Everything was entirely new to me before this class I had absolutely no coding knowledge at all

Did you learn anything new about web design (ie using media, color, fonts)?

For the most part there was not too much I learned in the design aspect of things other than the functional and coding portions which was entirely new to me.  That is because I have been designing in photoshop and other such mediums I just couldn't code so that part is what was new.

Free Response: Summarize your work cycle for this assignment

For this assignment I went back to past projects and learning materials and worked along side those.  Other than that I tried to do things from memory and I used photoshop to match and pick colors (using screenshots and images with the color I wanted along with the eye dropper tool to look up the RGB values).
