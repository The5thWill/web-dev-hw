          <h1>Death of a Mountain</h1>

        <div id="Paragraph 1" class="content">
          <p>Look hard and you can find Lost Mountain in grid 71, coordinate B-10 of the Kentucky Atlas & Gazetteer.
            According to that topological map, the summit rises 1,847 feet above Lost Creek, whose headwaters come to life on the
            mountain's north face. This morning I left the bluegrass region of central Kentucky, where I live, and drove east along
            the Mountain Parkway, where the last of the rolling grasslands, dotted with black tobacco barns, finally gives way
            to the Cumberland Plateau, the foothills of which may be the oldest mountain range in the world, the Appalachians.
            From there, a narrow two-lane road follows the meanderings of Lost Creek, so named because hunters frequently lost
            their bearings when they ventured too far from the stream itself. When the blacktop ends, I navigate an old logging
            road that winds up and around Lost Mountain, ending at its peak. I set the parking brake on my truck and get out to
            take a look around.</p>

        <div id="Paragraph 2" class="content" >
          <p>I notice that a fire tower standing here a year ago has been blown or torn from its foundation and sent crashing
            down the ridge side. But even without the tower's perspective, looking off to the north I can see thousands of acres
            - former summits - that have been flattened by mountaintop mining. Where once there were jagged, forested ridgelines,
             now there is only a series of plateaus, staggered grey shelves where grass struggles to grow in crushed rock and
             shale. When visitors to eastern Kentucky first see the effects of this kind of mining, they often say the landscape
             looks like the Southwest - a harsh tableland interrupted by steep mesas. I, too, have traveled through Arizona and
             New Mexico in the late spring when ocotillo and Indian paintbrush are in bloom, and I understand the allure of that
             harsh landscape. But this is not the desert Southwest; it is an eastern broadleaf forest. At least it should be.</p>

        <div id="Paragraph 3" class="content">
          <p>There was a time in this region when union miners would have extracted the coal that lies beneath Lost Mountain with
            hand picks and shovels in deep underground shafts. But twenty-six years after Jimmy Carter signed into law the Surface
             Mining Control and Reclamation Act (SMCRA), the coal industry has developed much more expedient and much more
             destructive methods of mining. Instead of excavating the contour of a ridge side, as strip miners did throughout
             the 1960s and '70s, now entire mountaintops are blasted off, and almost everything that isn't coal is pushed down
             into the valleys below. As a result, the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that more than 700 miles of
             healthy streams have been buried by mountaintop removal - some say the number is twice that - and hundreds more have
             been damaged. Blasting on the mine sites has cracked the foundations of nearby homes and polluted hundreds of family
              wells. Creeks run orange with sulfuric acid and heavy metals. Wildlife populations have been summarily dispersed.
              An entire ecosystem has been dismantled.</p>

          <p>I have come to Lost Mountain because in February Leslie Resources Inc. was granted a state permit to mine this
            ridgeline. I came here to see what an eastern mountain looks like before, during, and after its transformation
            into a western desert.</p>
